        <p class="text">"Inheriting your uncle‚Äôs supervillain business is complicated than you might think. Particularly when you discover who‚Äôs running the place.

            Charlie‚Äôs life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan.
            
            Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie.
            
            But becoming a supervillain isn‚Äôt . Jake had enemies, and now they‚Äôre coming after Charlie. His uncle might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are the real thing: rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture capital.
            
            It‚Äôs up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyper-intelligent talking spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look pretty good.
            
            In a dog-eat-dog world‚Ä¶be a cat."</p>

        <p class="text">
            "A whirlwind romp through everyday science, perfect for fans of How Stuff Works, Stuff You Should Know and Netflix‚Äôs Explained.

            In this quirky and endlessly surprising book, scientist and award-winning YouTuber Dr. Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim tells us about the amazing science behind everyday things (like drinking water,) and not-so-everyday things (like space travel and baby dinosaurs). Come along for the ride of a lifetime!
            
            Perfect for armchair scientists: a wide range of information means readers will never get bored.
            Told over the course of a single day: Mai shows the scientific reactions that occur from morning to bedtime.
            Quirky illustrations: break up the text and help readers visualize scientific reactions.
            Surprising facts: learn why an alarm clock triggers fight-or-flight, what alcohol does to our bodies (and minds), and the science behind the term ‚Äúlove drunk‚Äù (plus so much more).
            See the world in a new way: Mai shows us that science is behind everything we do and feel.
            Accessible and fun: Mai shows us that we don‚Äôt have to be scientists to think like one.
            Chemistry for Breakfast turns the ordinary into extraordinary,"

            ‚ÄúSpace is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can‚Äôt walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it‚Äôs possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA‚Äôs new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth.‚Äù
